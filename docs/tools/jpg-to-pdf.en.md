# JPG to PDF

Convert your images to a PDF document, with options to adjust orientation and margins.

## How to Use

1.  **Upload JPG Images**: Click the "Select Files" button to choose one or more images you want to convert.
2.  **Adjust Order**: If you uploaded multiple images, you can drag them to adjust their page order in the PDF.
3.  **Set Options**: Set the page orientation (landscape/portrait) and margin size as needed.
4.  **Generate PDF**: Click the "Convert" or "Generate PDF" button.
5.  **Download File**: After processing, click the "Download" button to get your PDF file.

## Notes

- The more images you upload, the larger the resulting PDF file will be, and the longer the processing time may take.
- Please be mindful of the original resolution of the images, as low-resolution images may appear blurry in the PDF.
