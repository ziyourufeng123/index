# Win12 Web Version

## Functionality Overview

An online simulator that allows you to experience the Windows 12 concept design directly in your browser. It is not a complete operating system, but a highly realistic interface and feature demonstration, allowing you to glimpse the future of operating systems without installing any software.

## How to Use

1.  **Open Page**: Navigate to the tool's page, and the Win12 interface will load automatically.
2.  **Explore Interface**: Click the "Start" menu, open "File Explorer," and interact with desktop icons just like in a real system.
3.  **Experience Apps**: Try opening some built-in web applications to get a feel for their interactive design.

## Important Notes

-   This tool is only for feature and interface demonstration; it cannot run local `.exe` programs or access your local file system.
-   All operations are simulated within the browser environment. All states will reset after closing the tab.

This deployment is for user online experience only. [Original Author's Repository](https://github.com/tjy-gitnub/win12)

# Windows 12 Web Version

> **ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰Happy first birthday to Windows 12 Web Version! `o(^o^)o`**
> **Sincere thanks to everyone for your support!**

```
Through ancient winters and summers, a year passes through autumns and springs. A long wind breaks the waves and rises, stars emerge in the deep night.
Where to find a soulmate in the world, through spring, autumn, winter, and summer, you are by my side.
With you all the way, even if ice blocks the Yellow River, and snow covers the Taihang, fear not, a man should not be underestimated in his youth.
May I be like a star and you like the moon, shining brightly together every night.

Grateful for everyone's support and encouragement, criticism and suggestions over the past year.
With everyone's efforts, the future of Windows 12 will be even brighter!
â€”â€”â€”â€”Xingyuan 23/8/28

```
Nine springs of arduous study, one morning to determine destiny.
The mountains are crossed, the clouds disperse, the morning glow finally reaches ten thousand paths.
Waiting to achieve success and write on the goldenæ¦œ, then reminisce about the past year!
See you later, see you next year, friends, I bid you farewell!

## Pre-preface

Recently (not long ago), I saw some people impersonating us, so I'm making a statement here:

Our project is jointly developed by tjy-gitnub (junior high student), NB-group (preparatory student), and 782 (first-year middle school student), three developers!

(If you are making a promotional video for us, please also link our Bilibili accounts.)

We only have official accounts on GitHub, Bilibili, and AfDian!

## Preface

Recently (a long time ago), after seeing the Windows 12 concept version (Powered by PowerPoint), I was greatly inspired to create a Windows 12 web version, similar to [Windows 11 web version](https://win11.blueedge.me/).

Refer to [Future Plans](#future-plans).

Exquisite UI design, smooth and rich animations, and various advanced functions (compared to the web version).

> Mobile adaptation is not very complete, just make do with the desktop version website `>v-)o`
