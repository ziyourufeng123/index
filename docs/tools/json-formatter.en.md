# JSON Formatter

## Introduction

Format, validate, compress, and beautify JSON data, providing detailed data structure analysis.

## How to Use

1.  **Paste JSON**: Paste your JSON string into the input box.
2.  **Perform Action**:
    - Click "Format" or "Beautify" to organize the JSON into a well-indented format.
    - Click "Compress" to remove all whitespace from the JSON, turning it into a single line.
    - The tool will usually perform "Validation" automatically and indicate if there are syntax errors in the JSON code.
3.  **View Result**: See the processed JSON data in the output area, or browse its structure in a tree view.

## Notes

- Incorrectly formatted JSON code cannot be processed correctly; please correct any errors based on the validation prompts first.
- You may experience slight browser lag when processing very large JSON files.
