## How to Use

2.  **Choose Mode**: Select either "Convert page by page to JPG" or "Extract images only".
3.  **Start Conversion**: Click the "Convert" button to begin processing.
4.  **Download Images**: After processing, the tool will provide a ZIP archive containing all the JPG images for you to download, or you can download them individually.

## Notes

- The conversion quality depends on the original resolution of the PDF. If the PDF itself has low clarity, the output JPG images will also be blurry.
