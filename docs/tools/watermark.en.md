# Add Watermark

## Introduction

Quickly add an image or text watermark to your pictures. Choose the style, transparency, and position.

2.  **Set Watermark**:
    -   **Text Watermark**: Enter your watermark text and set the font, color, size, and opacity.
    -   **Image Watermark**: Upload your logo or watermark image and set its size and opacity.
3.  **Choose Position**: Set the position of the watermark on the image using a 9-grid layout or by dragging.

## Notes

- For best results, it is recommended to use a PNG image with a transparent background for the watermark.
- Adjusting the transparency appropriately can protect copyright without significantly affecting the appearance of the original image.
