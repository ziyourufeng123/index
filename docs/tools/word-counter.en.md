# Advanced Word Counter

## Introduction

A professional text analysis tool that supports advanced features like word frequency statistics, language detection, and reading time estimation.

## How to Use

1.  **Paste Text**: Paste the full text you want to analyze into the input box.
2.  **Automatic Analysis**: The tool will typically process the text automatically and display the analysis results immediately.
3.  **View Report**: In the results area, you can see information such as total word count, character count, a list of word frequencies, language type, and estimated reading time.

## Notes

- The accuracy of language detection and reading time estimation depends on the standardization of the text.
- Word frequency statistics automatically ignore common stop words (e.g., "the", "is") to provide more meaningful results.
