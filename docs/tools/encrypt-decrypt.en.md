# Text Encrypt/Decrypt

## Introduction

Supports various encryption and decryption methods like URL encoding, Base64, MD5, SHA1, and SHA256.

## How to Use

1.  **Select Algorithm**: Choose the encryption or encoding type you need from the dropdown menu or tabs.
2.  **Enter Plaintext**: Paste the text you want to process into the "Plaintext" or "Input" box.
3.  **Perform Operation**: Click the "Encrypt" or "Encode" button.
4.  **Get Result**: The result will be displayed in the "Ciphertext" or "Output" box, which you can copy with one click.
5.  **Decrypt/Decode**: For reversible encodings (like Base64), you can paste the ciphertext into the corresponding input box to decrypt it.

## Notes

- MD5 and the SHA series are one-way hash algorithms and cannot be "decrypted"; they are only used to verify data integrity.
- Base64 and URL encoding are reversible encoding methods, not strong encryption techniques.
