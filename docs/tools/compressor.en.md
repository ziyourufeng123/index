# Compress Image

## Introduction

Compress JPG, PNG, SVG, and GIF files while saving space and maintaining quality.

## How to Use

1.  **Upload Images**: Click the upload area to select one or more image files that need to be compressed.
2.  **Adjust Compression Level**: If the tool provides this option, you can select a compression level (e.g., low, medium, high) to find a balance between file size and image quality.
3.  **Start Compression**: Click the "Compress" button, and the tool will automatically process your images.
4.  **Download Files**: After processing, you can see a comparison of the file sizes before and after compression and download the compressed images.

## Notes

- Compression is a lossy process (especially for JPG), and excessive compression can lead to a noticeable decrease in image quality.
- Compression for PNG and GIF is usually lossless, but the effect on reducing file size may not be as significant as with JPG.
