# Markdown Editor

## Introduction

A Markdown editor with real-time preview that allows you to export documents and copy HTML.

## How to Use

1.  **Write Content**: Write your document using Markdown syntax in the left editing area.
2.  **Live Preview**: See the real-time rendered effect in the right preview area.
3.  **Use Toolbar**: (If available) Use the shortcut buttons on the toolbar to insert common formats like bold, italics, lists, links, etc.
4.  **Export File**: After finishing, use the "Export" function to save your document as a file, or use the "Copy HTML" function to get code that can be used on a webpage.

## Notes

- Different Markdown renderers may have slight differences in detail, but the preview effect is generally universal.
