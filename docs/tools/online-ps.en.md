# Online PS

## Introduction

Edit and process images directly in your browser offline without installing software. All data is processed locally, so there's no need to worry about privacy leaks.

## How to Use

1.  **Open or Create a File**: You can open an image from your computer or create a new blank canvas.
2.  **Use the Toolbox**: Like the desktop version of PS, use the toolbox on the left to select tools like brushes, selections, text, erasers, etc.
3.  **Layer Operations**: Manage your layers in the layers panel on the right, including merging, ordering, and adjusting opacity.
4.  **Apply Adjustments and Filters**: Find and apply effects like color balance, brightness/contrast, and filters from the top menu.
5.  **Export Your Work**: When finished, save your work as PNG, JPG, etc., through the "File" -> "Export as" menu.

## Notes

- Since it runs in the browser, you may experience performance bottlenecks when handling very large files or numerous layers.
- Please remember to save your important work frequently to prevent accidental loss from a browser crash.
