# Markdown Editor (New)

## Introduction

A Markdown editor with real-time preview, including syntax shortcut buttons, and the ability to export to PDF, PNG, and HTML.

## How to Use

1.  **Write & Preview**: Write using Markdown syntax in the left editor pane, and the beautifully formatted output will appear synchronously on the right.
2.  **Use Shortcut Buttons**: Click the buttons on the toolbar to quickly insert elements like headings, lists, code blocks, etc., without needing to remember all the syntax.
3.  **Export Your Work**: When finished, select your desired format (PDF, PNG, or HTML) from the export menu to easily share or publish your document.

## Notes

- PDF and PNG export functionality relies on client-side rendering, and the appearance of complex documents may vary between browsers.
- This is an enhanced editor that offers more features than the basic version.
