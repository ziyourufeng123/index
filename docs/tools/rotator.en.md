# Rotate Image

## Introduction

Rotate multiple JPG, PNG, or GIF images at the same time. Rotate only a certain number of them at a time!

## How to Use

1.  **Upload Images**: Select the image files you need to rotate.
2.  **Choose Rotation Angle**: Click "Rotate Left", "Rotate Right", or enter a custom rotation angle value.
3.  **Apply Rotation**: The tool will display a preview of the rotated image.
4.  **Download Image**: Click the "Download" button to save the rotation-corrected image.

## Notes

- Rotating by an angle that is not a multiple of 90 degrees may result in areas of the image that need to be filled or cropped.
- For animated GIFs, the rotation may be applied to all frames.
