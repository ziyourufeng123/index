# Resize Image

## Introduction

Define dimensions by percentage or pixels and resize JPG, PNG, SVG, and GIF images.

## How to Use

1.  **Upload Image**: Click the "Select File" button to upload the image you need to resize.
2.  **Define New Dimensions**: You can choose to scale by "percentage" or by "pixels".
    -   **By Percentage**: Enter a percentage value (e.g., "50%"), and the image will be scaled down to half its original size.
    -   **By Pixels**: Enter a new width or height pixel value; the tool will typically maintain the aspect ratio by default.
3.  **Start Resizing**: Click the "Start" or "Apply" button to process the image.
4.  **Download Image**: After processing, you can preview the resized image and click the "Download" button to save it locally.

## Notes

- Resizing can affect image quality, especially when enlarging an image.
- Please be mindful of maintaining the aspect ratio to avoid image stretching or distortion.
- Supported image formats for processing include JPG, PNG, SVG, and GIF.
