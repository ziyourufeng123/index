# Text Diff

## Introduction

Compare the differences between two texts and highlight the differences.

## How to Use

1.  **Paste Text**: Paste the original text (Version A) into the left text box.
2.  **Paste New Text**: Paste the modified text (Version B) into the right text box.
3.  **Perform Comparison**: Click the "Compare" or "Find Differences" button.
4.  **View Results**: The tool will immediately highlight all differences between the two texts.

## Examples

- **Left Input**: `Hello world`
- **Right Input**: `Hello beautiful world!`
- **Result**: The words `beautiful` and `!` in the right text will be highlighted as new additions.

## Notes

- For very large texts, the processing may take a moment.
- Pay attention to differences in invisible characters like spaces and newlines, as they will also be marked by the tool.
